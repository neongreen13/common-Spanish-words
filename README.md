# Common Spanish Words
A learning tool to study the most frequently used Spanish words found in song lyrics as a way for non-Spanish speakers to learn the language in an efficient manner.

# Background
With thousands of words, the thought of learning another language can be daunting and overwhelming. Based on Tim Ferris' article, 12 Rules for Learning Foreign Languages in Record Time — The Only Post You’ll Ever Need (https://tim.blog/2014/03/21/how-to-learn-a-foreign-language-2/), the first rule is to focus one's time on learning the most common words in a new language. Ferris says, "20% of the effort you spend on acquiring new vocab could ultimately give you 80% comprehension in a language—for instance, in English just 300 words make up 65% of all written material. We use those words a lot, and that’s the case in every other language as well." As a native English speaker, I wanted to brush up on my Spanish before taking a trip to Mexico with my brother, who speaks near fluent Spanish after living in Colombia for a year. This sparked the idea to create a data-driven learning tool to find out how I can hack learning Spanish in a few months.

# Step 1 - Hypothesis - Spanish Key Notebook
I downloaded a list of 250 common Spanish words that were used to form my hypothesis as a starting point. The words were posted on a site and taken from a learning dictionary.

# Step 2 - Collect the Data - Song List Notebook
Pop culture found in music and film are an excellent way to learn listening comprehension as well as cultural nuances when learning a language. To test the hypothesis, I turned to Latin music lyrics as the words in each song can easliy be downloaded (as opposed to film scripts). The data collection phase consisted of downloading a list top Latin songs from Billboard.com. 

Next, I will need to work with Genius.com and their API to download the song lyrics and put into a dataframe for text analysis. 

# Step 3 - Text Analysis
Initial text analysis has been performed on a sample of four Latin song lyrics. Text analysis includes two phases: using SpaCy Spanish to divide the lyrics into categories of nouns, verbs, pronouns, and stopwords.
